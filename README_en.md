**EasyKiConverter** is a modern C++ desktop tool based on Qt 6 and MVVM architecture, designed for electronics engineers to efficiently convert component data from LCSC and EasyEDA into KiCad, Altium, or Xpedition ASCII library files. Supports both GUI and CLI modes.

### Version and Capability Boundaries

- The latest stable release is **v3.1.11**. Stable downloads and capabilities are defined by the [v3.1.11 Release](https://github.com/EasyKiconverter/EasyKiConverter/releases/tag/v3.1.11).
- **v3.1.12** is currently a pre-release. It contains subsequent cross-platform packaging and Xpedition improvements and is not the stable release line.
- `master` is the development branch. The Altium, Xpedition, and unified IR capabilities described below reflect the source branch; check the relevant Release notes before using a stable package.

## Key Features

*   **Multiple Targets**: Supports KiCad symbols/footprints, Altium SchLib/PcbLib, and Xpedition ASCII symbol/footprint packages; Altium embeds STEP models, while Xpedition 3D model association is not currently written.
*   **Multi-unit Symbols**: Support for multi-unit symbol conversion.
*   **Efficient Batch Processing**: Multi-threaded parallel conversion and BOM file import support, fully utilizing multi-core performance.
*   **Modern Experience**: Fluid UI based on Qt Quick, supporting dark/light theme switching.
*   **Smart Configuration**: Real-time auto-save of settings, supporting breakpoint memory and debug mode state restoration.
*   **Smart Assistance**: Support for intelligent extraction of component IDs from clipboard.
*   **LCSC Preview Images**: Automatically fetch LCSC component preview images, supporting thumbnail display and hover preview.
*   **CLI Mode**: Pure command-line mode for batch processing and automation scripts.

## Quick Start

### Installation
Please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/EasyKiconverter/EasyKiConverter/releases) page to download the version for your platform:
