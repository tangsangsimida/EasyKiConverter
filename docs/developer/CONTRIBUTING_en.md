# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EasyKiConverter! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you:

1. Have read the project documentation:
   - [Project Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - [Build Guide](BUILD.md)
   - [Features Documentation](FEATURES.md)

2. Have successfully built the project locally

3. Are familiar with:
   - C++ programming language
   - Qt framework (Qt Quick, Qt Network, etc.)
   - CMake build system
   - MVVM architecture pattern
   - Git version control

## Setting Up Development Environment

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EasyKiConverter_QT.git
   cd EasyKiConverter_QT
   ```

### 2. Configure Remotes

Add the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tangsangsimida/EasyKiConverter_QT.git
```

### 3. Create a Development Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## Code Standards

### C++ Coding Standards

Follow Qt coding standards:

#### Naming Conventions

- **Class names**: PascalCase
  ```cpp
  class ComponentService { };
  ```

- **Function names**: camelCase
  ```cpp
  void loadData();
  ```

- **Variable names**: camelCase
  ```cpp
  int componentId;
  ```

- **Member variables**: m_ prefix, camelCase
  ```cpp
  int m_componentId;
  ```

- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  ```cpp
  const int MAX_RETRIES = 3;
  ```

#### File Organization

- Header files (.h) and implementation files (.cpp) should be separated
- Each class should have its own header and implementation file
- QML files should be organized by function module
- Resource files should be placed in the `resources/` directory

#### Comments

- Use Doxygen-style comments for classes and public methods
  ```cpp
  /**
   * @brief Loads component data from EasyEDA API
   * @param componentId The component ID to load
   * @return ComponentData The loaded component data
   */
  ComponentData loadComponent(const QString& componentId);
  ```

- Add inline comments for complex logic
  ```cpp
  // Calculate arc center using SVG arc parameters
  double centerX = ...;
  ```

#### C++ Features

- Use C++17 features
- Use smart pointers (QSharedPointer, QScopedPointer) for resource management
- Use Qt's signal-slot mechanism for object communication
- Follow RAII principles
- **File Encoding**: All source files (`.cpp`, `.h`, `.qml`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.) MUST use **UTF-8 (without BOM)** encoding. Encodings like UTF-8 with BOM or GBK are strictly prohibited.

### QML Coding Standards

- **Component names**: PascalCase
  ```qml
  ModernButton { }
  ```

- **Property names**: camelCase
  ```qml
  property string componentId: ""
  ```

- **ID names**: camelCase
  ```qml
  Button { id: componentInput }
  ```

- **Code formatting**: 4-space indentation
- **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments

## Architecture Requirements

### MVVM Architecture

Follow the MVVM architecture pattern:

- **View Layer (QML)**: Responsible for UI display only
- **ViewModel Layer**: Manages UI state and business logic coordination
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic
- **Model Layer**: Handles data storage

### Export Service Architecture

Use multi-stage pipeline parallelism architecture (ExportServicePipeline):

- **Fetch Stage**: I/O-intensive, 32 threads
- **Process Stage**: CPU-intensive, CPU core count threads
- **Write Stage**: Disk I/O-intensive, 8 threads
- Stages communicate via thread-safe bounded queues
- See: [ADR-002: Pipeline Parallelism](../project/adr/002-pipeline-parallelism-for-export_en.md)
