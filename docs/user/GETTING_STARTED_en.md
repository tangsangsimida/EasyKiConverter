#### Method 2: Smart Extraction

1. Copy component numbers from any source (e.g., BOM, website)
2. Click the "Paste" button
3. The application will automatically extract valid component numbers
4. Click "Add" to add all extracted components

#### Method 3: BOM Import

1. Click the "Import BOM" button
2. Select your BOM file (CSV or Excel format)
3. The application will parse and import all components

### Step 3: Configure Export Settings

1. Select the export directory
2. Choose what to export:
   - Symbols
   - Footprints
   - 3D Models
3. Configure additional options:
   - Overwrite existing files
   - Enable debug export (for developers)

### Step 4: Start Conversion

1. Click the "Convert" button
2. Wait for the conversion to complete
3. Monitor progress in the progress section

### Step 5: Review Results

After conversion completes:

1. Check the results list for success/failure status
2. Click on items to view details
3. Navigate to the export directory to view generated files

## Using Converted Components in KiCad

### Importing Symbol Library

1. Open KiCad
2. Go to "Preferences" -> "Manage Symbol Libraries"
3. Click "Add Existing Library"
4. Navigate to the export directory
5. Select the `.kicad_sym` file
6. Click "OK"

### Importing Footprint Library

1. Open KiCad
2. Go to "Preferences" -> "Manage Footprint Libraries"
3. Click "Add Existing Library"
4. Navigate to the export directory
5. Select the `.pretty` folder
6. Click "OK"

### Using Components

1. In KiCad Schematic Editor, press "A" to add a component
2. Search for your component by name
3. Place the component in your schematic
4. In PCB Editor, the footprint will be automatically associated

## Common Use Cases

### Converting a Single Component

1. Enter the component number (e.g., `C123456`)
2. Click "Add"
3. Configure export settings
4. Click "Convert"
5. Use the component in KiCad

### Batch Converting Components

1. Copy multiple component numbers from a BOM
2. Click "Paste" to extract them
3. Click "Add" to add all components
4. Configure export settings
5. Click "Convert"
6. Wait for all components to be converted

### Converting with 3D Models

1. Add components as usual
2. In export settings, enable "3D Models"
3. Click "Convert"
4. The application will automatically download and convert 3D models
5. In KiCad PCB Editor, view the 3D model by pressing "Alt + 3"

## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Component Input

- Use smart extraction to quickly add multiple components
- Import BOM files for batch conversion
- Keep a list of commonly used component numbers

### Export Organization

- Create separate folders for different projects
- Use descriptive folder names
- Keep symbol and footprint libraries together

### Performance Optimization

- Convert multiple components at once for better performance
- Use parallel conversion for large batches
- Close other applications to free up resources

### Troubleshooting

- If a component fails to convert, check the component number
- Ensure you have an internet connection for downloading data
- Verify the export directory has write permissions
- Check the results list for error messages

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter` - Add component from input field
- `Ctrl+V` - Paste and extract component numbers
- `Ctrl+A` - Select all components
- `Delete` - Remove selected components
- `F5` - Refresh component list
- `Ctrl+E` - Open export settings
- `Ctrl+C` - Start conversion

## Configuration

### Theme Settings

1. Click the theme toggle button (light/dark icon)
2. Choose your preferred theme:
   - Light mode
   - Dark mode
   - System default

### Export Settings

1. Click the "Settings" button
2. Configure default export options:
   - Default export directory
   - Default export types
   - Overwrite behavior
3. Click "Save" to apply settings

### Debug Settings

For developers:

1. Enable debug export in settings
2. Original and exported data will be saved
3. Check the debug directory for detailed logs

## Common Issues

### Issue: Component Not Found

**Solution:**
- Verify the component number is correct
- Check if the component exists in LCSC database
- Ensure you have an internet connection

### Issue: Conversion Failed

**Solution:**
- Check the error message in the results list
- Verify the component data is available
- Try converting the component again

### Issue: 3D Model Not Downloaded

**Solution:**
- Ensure "3D Models" is enabled in export settings
- Check if the component has a 3D model
- Verify your internet connection

### Issue: Files Not Found in KiCad

**Solution:**
- Verify the library path in KiCad settings
- Check if the files are in the correct directory
- Refresh KiCad's library list

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Layer Mapping

For advanced users, you can customize layer mapping:

1. Edit the layer mapping configuration
2. Map EasyEDA layers to KiCad layers
3. Save your custom mapping
